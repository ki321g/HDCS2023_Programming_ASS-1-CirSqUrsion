## Higher Diploma in Computer Science 2023
## Programming Fundamentals Assignment#1 - CirSqUrsion

This is my first assignment that will contribute to my grade for the semester. I called it CirSqUrsion

It is worth 15% of my overall grade. 

It is based on what was covered on the first 3 weeks (talks, labs - steps, exercises, and challenges). I won't need to use anything else, in fact using code not covered will mean I fall foul of the constraints with big implications for your score.

I was asked to create a generative art piece encorporating a grid theme by using an animated interactive drawing. 

The grid(s) can be regular. It might also be irregular as seen in the modern art works of Piet Mondrian and assoicatied with De Stijl and Bahaus.
